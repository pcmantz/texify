* Model
** Async & Concurrent Rendering
   latex and dvipng can be run concurrently.  We don't need to block on the
   .dvi file rendering since dvipng doesn't need a complete file to start.
** Trim excess transparent boundaries w/ ImageMagick
   The dvipng step removes some, but not all of the dead transparent pixels.
   Remove them all with ImageMagick.

* Controller
** Content Types
   Add content handling by Accept header.  Mojo appears to support this out of
   the box, so see how we can use it.  This may force a more object-oriented
   approach to the model, rather than simple path names.
** Revisit Convenience Routing
   A feature of the current texify.com site is embedding the TeX equation into
   the URL path to the image. That was useful for testing rendering, but a
   pain when writing the HTML for the application (what should have been 404
   errors were being replaced with png files).  See if it's worthwhile to add
   back in.

* View
** Styling
   I'm not a designer, but the site could use better styling. Go minimalist to
   dodge most of the issue, methinks.
** Remove all the junk text.
   Next time, use Lorem Ipsum.  Or, use Lorem Ipsum right now!
** Icons
   I disabled these because I didn't see a need for them.  Investigate whether
   using these is worthwhile.
** Header Strip
   I have a hardcoded header strip which doesn't add any value, since there
   aren't any other pages.  I should add some contact information and
   description text for good measure.
